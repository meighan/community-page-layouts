Lightning Community Page Layouts

With the Summer '18 release we launched pre-built themes - built by our own UX teams at Salesforce. Now, we are allowing you to build your own custom themes, package them up, and share and re-use them internally as well as sharing them across the entire Salesforce ecosystem. To celebrate, we're hosting a DemoJam where our Trailblazers will showcase their work, and the winner will be declared for the sharpest, coolest, and most beautiful theme.
